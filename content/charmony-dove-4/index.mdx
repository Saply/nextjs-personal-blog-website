One ☝️ day ☀️, after ⏱️ dinner 🍽, while ⌛️ my 🫵 younger 🧒 sister 🦢 and I 📆 were lounging 🥱 about in Mr. Gopher 🦫 Wood’s 🪵 yard 📏, we 🦢📆 spotted 🐆 a fledgling 🐣 Charmony 🎶 Dove 🕊 all 🕵️‍♂️ on its own 😔. That baby 👶 bird 🕊 was tiny 🐥, it didn’t even ❌ have all 🔄 of its feathers 🪶, and it couldn’t sing 🎶. When we found 🧐 it, it was already ⚠️ on its last 😢 breath 💨, having fallen ⬇️ into a shrub 🌳— probably 🤔 abandoned 🏃‍♂️ by its parents 👨‍👩‍👧. We decided 💡 to build 🏗 a nest 🪺 for it right 🕰 there and then ⌚️.

However 🛑, thinking 💭 back 🕰, that winter ❄️ was unusually ⛔️ cold 🥶, with fierce 🐯 winds 🌬 at night 🌙 in the yard 🏡, not to mention 🗣 the many 🍀 poisonous ☠️ bugs 🦟 and wild 🐗 beasts 🐻 in the vicinity 📍... It was clear 🧐 that if we left 🚶‍♂️ the fledgling 🐣 in the yard 🌳, it stood 🚫 no chance 🎰 of surviving 💀 until spring 🌼. So 🌐, I suggested 💬 we take 🛐 it inside 🏠, place 🛋 it on the shelf 🗄 by the window 🪟, and asked 🫵 the adults 👨‍👩‍👧 to fashion 🧵 a cage 🦜 for it.

We decided 🧠 that when it regained 💪 its strength 🦾 enough to spread 👐 its wings 🪽, we would release 🏃 it back 🔙 into the wild 🌳. The tragic 😢 part — something 🧠 that we’d never ❌ considered 🤔— was that this bird 🕊’s fate 🎭 had already ⚠️ been determined 📝 long 🕰 before 🕛 this moment 🔴... Its destiny 🔮 was determined 🗣 by our momentary ⏳ whim 🌬.

Now 🕰, I pass 🎁 the power 💪 of choice ⚖️ to you all 🫵. Faced with this situation 🚨, what choice ⚖️ would you make 🤔? Stick to 🖇 the original 🏁 plan 🗺, and build 🛠 a nest 🪺 with soft 💫 net 🎣 where the Charmony 🎶 Dove 🕊 fell ⬇️? Or build 🏗 a cage 🦜 for it, and feed 🍽 it, giving 👐 it the utmost 🏆 care 🫂 from within 🔄 the warmth 🔥 of a home 🏠?

I eagerly ⏳ await ⏱️ your answer 🗣

## Introduction
Today i'll be solving the [Encoding - Encoding Challenge](https://cryptohack.org/challenges/general/) on CryptoHack.

> Now you've got the hang of the various encodings you'll be encountering, let's have a look at automating it.
>
> Can you pass all 100 levels to get the flag?
>
> The 13377.py file attached below is the source code for what's running on the server. The pwntools_example.py file provides the start of a solution.
>
> For more information about connecting to interactive challenges, see the FAQ. Feel free to skip ahead to the cryptography if you aren't in the mood for a coding challenge!
>
> If you want to run and test the challenge locally, then check the FAQ to download the utils.listener module.
> Connect at `socket.cryptohack.org 13377`

## Details
This question involves continuously solving 100 encoding challenges, the challenge also provides two files used to assist us: 
### 13377.py
As mentioned in the question, this is the source code for the challenge which runs on the server. There are 5 encoding algorithms as highlighted below:

```py showLineNumbers {30-39} caption="https://cryptohack.org/static/challenges/13377_86793614535c47dea371d2f0e406dbd9.py"
from Crypto.Util.number import bytes_to_long, long_to_bytes
from utils import listener # this is cryptohack's server-side module and not part of python
import base64
import codecs
import random

FLAG = "crypto{????????????????????}"
ENCODINGS = [
    "base64",
    "hex",
    "rot13",
    "bigint",
    "utf-8",
]
with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as f:
    WORDS = [line.strip().replace("'", "") for line in f.readlines()]


class Challenge():
    def __init__(self):
        self.no_prompt = True # Immediately send data from the server without waiting for user input
        self.challenge_words = ""
        self.stage = 0

    def create_level(self):
        self.stage += 1
        self.challenge_words = "_".join(random.choices(WORDS, k=3))
        encoding = random.choice(ENCODINGS)

        if encoding == "base64":
            encoded = base64.b64encode(self.challenge_words.encode()).decode() # wow so encode
        elif encoding == "hex":
            encoded = self.challenge_words.encode().hex()
        elif encoding == "rot13":
            encoded = codecs.encode(self.challenge_words, 'rot_13')
        elif encoding == "bigint":
            encoded = hex(bytes_to_long(self.challenge_words.encode()))
        elif encoding == "utf-8":
            encoded = [ord(b) for b in self.challenge_words]

        return {"type": encoding, "encoded": encoded}

    #
    # This challenge function is called on your input, which must be JSON
    # encoded
    #
    def challenge(self, your_input):
        if self.stage == 0:
            return self.create_level()
        elif self.stage == 100:
            self.exit = True
            return {"flag": FLAG}

        if self.challenge_words == your_input["decoded"]:
            return self.create_level()

        return {"error": "Decoding fail"}


import builtins; builtins.Challenge = Challenge # hack to enable challenge to be run locally, see https://cryptohack.org/faq/#listener
listener.start_server(port=13377)
```

- **base64** is just regular base64, for example `Y29uc3VsdGF0aW9uX2lzbGFuZF9yZXNwb25k` which when decoded becomes `consultation_island_respond`.
- **hex** refers to a hexadecimal value *without* the 0x prepended to it, for example `64695f6269645f6c79636f73` which when decoded becomes `di_bid_lycos`.
- **rot13** is a substitution cipher algorithm which replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, for example `yf_nhgb_vaqvr` which when decoded becomes `ls_auto_indie` 
- **bigint** refers to a hexadecimal value *with* the "0x" prepended to it, one such example is `0x6d65646c696e655f6d696e65735f636f6e74656e7473` which when decoded becomes `medline_mines_contents`.
- **utf-8** refers to the ASCII representation of a letter. It's sent as an array of integers such as `[114, 101, 115, 111, 108, 117, 116, 105, 111, 110, 95, 115, 109, 97, 108, 108, 101, 114, 95, 101, 108, 101, 99, 116, 114, 105, 99, 105, 116, 121]`, which when decoded becomes `resolution_smaller_electricity`




### pwntools_example.py
This is a helper file for sending data to the server hosting the source code, it uses the pwntools library to send/receive data. We can modify this code to run in a loop.
```py caption="https://cryptohack.org/static/challenges/pwntools_example_f93ca6ccef2def755aa8f6d9aa6e9c5b.py"
from pwn import * # pip install pwntools
import json

r = remote('socket.cryptohack.org', 13377, level = 'debug')

def json_recv():
    line = r.recvline()
    return json.loads(line.decode())

def json_send(hsh):
    request = json.dumps(hsh).encode()
    r.sendline(request)


received = json_recv()

print("Received type: ")
print(received["type"])
print("Received encoded value: ")
print(received["encoded"])

to_send = {
    "decoded": "changeme"
}
json_send(to_send)

json_recv()"
```

## Final Code
This is my Python implementation for solving the question. The code first receives a JSON containing the type and encoded value from the server, then conditionally checks for what type of data is received using `received["type"]` and uses the respective decoding methods to transform them into a human readable format. Then, the decoded message gets sent to the server.
```python
from pwn import *
import json
import codecs
import base64

r = remote('socket.cryptohack.org', 13377, level = 'debug')

def json_recv():
    line = r.recvline()
    return json.loads(line.decode())

def json_send(hsh):
    request = json.dumps(hsh).encode()
    r.sendline(request)

for i in range(101):
    to_send = {
        "decoded": ""
    }
    received = json_recv()
    print("Received type: ")
    print(received["type"])
    print("Received encoded value: ")
    print(received["encoded"])
    
    # b'{"type": "rot13", "encoded": "synfu_ys_vaabingvbaf"}\n'
    if (received["type"] == "rot13"):
        s = codecs.decode(received["encoded"], "rot_13")
        to_send["decoded"] = s
        print(f"Decoded: {s}")
    
    # For hex with "0x"
    # b'{"type": "bigint", "encoded": "0x7669736974696e675f70726f6669745f73656c6c696e67"}\n'
    elif (received["type"] == "bigint"):
        # Remove first 2 letters "0x..."
        hexvaluewithout0x = received["encoded"][2:]
        s = bytes.fromhex(hexvaluewithout0x).decode("utf-8")
        to_send["decoded"] = s
        print(f"Decoded: {s}")
    
    # For hex without "0x"
    elif (received["type"] == "hex"):
        s = bytes.fromhex(received["encoded"]).decode("utf-8")
        to_send["decoded"] = s
        print(f"Decoded: {s}")
    
    # actually ASCII
    elif (received["type"] == "utf-8"):
        arr = received["encoded"]
        s = ""
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            s += (chr(arr[i]))
            
        to_send["decoded"] = s
        print(f"Decoded: {s}")
    
    # b'{"type": "base64", "encoded": "dXBzZXRfbWFjcm9fYXBuaWM="}\n'
    elif (received["type"] == "base64"):
        s = base64.b64decode(received["encoded"]).decode("utf-8")
        to_send["decoded"] = s
        print(f"Decoded: {s}")
    
    json_send(to_send)
```

The process repeats until the flag is obtained.

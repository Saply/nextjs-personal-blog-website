One day, after dinner, while my younger sister and I were vibing in Mr. Goated Wood's yard, we spotted a lowkey Charmony Dove all on its own. That baby bird was mid, it didn't even have all of its drip, and it couldn't rizz. When we found it, it was already on its L, having yeeted into a shrub — probably ghosted by its fam. We decided to stan for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter hit different, with cringe winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many sus bugs and based beasts amogus... It was clear that if we let the fledgling cook, it's giving no chance of glow-up. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the oomfs to F in the chat. We decided that when it regained its strength enough to flex, we would let it touch grass. The oof part — something that we'd never considered — was that this NPC's fate had already been cooked long before this moment... Its destiny was caught in 4k. Now, I pass the clout of choice to you all. Faced with this L+Ratio, what choice would you make? Stick to the delulu plan, and cope where the Charmony Dove fell? Or cagemaxx for it, and stan it, giving it the bussin care from within the boujee of a home? I eagerly await your hot takes.

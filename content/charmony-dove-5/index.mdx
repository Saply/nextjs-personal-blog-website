Just now hor, after we makan finish, while my mei mei and I go Mr. Gopher Wood's yard there kia kia, we saw only the lanj... Charmony Dove. That baby bird very small sia, somemore no feathers, and it buay jiao leh. When we see it, it almost kong kar kiao liao, fall inside a shrub — probably kenna pang seh by its parents. We then build a nest there lor. But hor there sibei cold, got a lot of wind and bugs and wild beasts... We scared that if we leave it there, it sure mati one, So, we bring inside and put on the shelf by the window, and ask the da ren to make a cage lor. Then hor when it bo lak liao to spread its wings, we would release it back into the wild. But sad thing is hor — we never use brain and think — was that this bird's fate long long time ago already decide liao... Its destiny we suka suka choose. Now, I ask you all ah, how ah? You see this situation how ah? Just build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell sua liao? Or go build cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home? What you think?
